**This recipe is made with a combination of cocoa powder and chocolate chips. The cocoa powder adds the distinct “hot cocoa” flavor, and the chocolate chips melt into the mixture making this drink extra creamy, rich and luxurious. A splash of vanilla extract rounds out all that chocolaty flavor and makes this what I consider the perfect Homemade Hot Chocolate.**

*Place the milk of your choice in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Using milk instead of water, makes this hot chocolate extra creamy and flavorful.*  

__I prefer whole milk or 2% milk, but you can choose any milk that you choose (I’ve even used unsweetened almond milk).__

Whisk in cocoa powder and sugar, and heat until warm.

 Once the milk is warm, add chocolate chips, whisking until they melt into the milk.

Add a splash of vanilla extract.

Serve immediately, topped with your favorite garnishes: marshmallows, whipped cream, chopped chocolate,crushed candy canes or more.😊😊😊😊............👍👍👍👍👍👍........
